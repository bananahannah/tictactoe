# tictactoe

**tictactoe** is a pacman, arcade themed version of tictactoe. Pac-Man and Ghost verse eachother in a game where nobody gets eaten to see who is victorious. 

This is an interactive, 2 player game built with HTML, CSS and Javascript 



The updated version will have an ability to track the game, and ideally choose your own player. These will happen as my coding knowledge and capabilities get beter :)


The game can be found here https://github.com/bananahannah/tictactoe
